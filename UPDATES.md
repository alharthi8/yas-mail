# Signed GitHub updates

Windows previews check GitHub on startup and from Settings > Check for app updates. Startup checks fail quietly offline; manual checks report failures. Users approve an update. Its signed ZIP is checked against the public key in release.pub, then the running executable is replaced using self_update/self-replace. Restart when convenient; the app does not kill active sends, downloads, or sessions. Fully quit Yas Browser through its tray when downloads keep it running.

Install the 0.3.1 bootstrap installer once. Older previews do not contain the updater. User data is outside the executable and retained. This channel updates the executable; changes requiring new runtimes or installation layout need a new full installer. The updater applies per-user writable installations and portable copies; it does not request administrator rights.

Maintainers: update Cargo version and tauri.conf.json, commit, then push a matching vVERSION tag. The Windows workflow builds/tests, creates a version-bound signed ZIP, verifies it using the built app, rejects a corrupted package, creates a draft with the bootstrap installer, then publishes. GitHub signing secret: YAS_UPDATE_SIGNING_KEY. Private keys never belong in source or release assets. Back up and retain the existing private key; replacing the key breaks existing clients unless key rotation support ships first.

The artifact signature is separate from Windows Authenticode publisher signing.

## macOS Apple Silicon previews

The macos/ subproject uses the same pinned per-app public key and a separate macos-vVERSION tag channel. An exact architecture/version asset name selects a signed ZIP containing the complete Yas Mail.app. ZIP signature verification and macOS bundle-signature verification happen before replacement. The complete app bundle is replaced; user data stays outside it. Users approve updates and fully quit/reopen afterwards. Install into a writable Applications folder. Intel is not supported by this channel.

For a Mac release, bump the version in macos/src-tauri/Cargo.toml and src-tauri/tauri.conf.json, update macos/RELEASE-NOTES.md, commit, and push a matching macos-vVERSION tag. The separate macos-release workflow builds/tests on Apple Silicon, checks the packaged native/frontend launch, tests a synthetic Keychain round-trip, verifies a signed full-bundle replacement and damaged-package rejection, and publishes a prerelease with --latest=false. Windows users keep the Windows latest release.

Current Mac previews have ad-hoc development signatures, not Apple Developer ID signatures or notarization. Those Apple distribution steps require separate publisher setup. Private update keys remain only in the existing GitHub secret and protected offline backup. Do not rotate them without a compatible migration.
